# ðŸš–  Car Sales Dataset Advanced Visualization Dashboard

This academic project is a multi-part interactive dashboard series that explores car sales trends and customer behavior. Using real-world-style data, I built a set of web-based tools to help users better understand patterns in vehicle features, buyer preferences, and market trends.

Each lab builds on the previous one, starting with simple charts and growing into full dashboards with dynamic filters, clustering, and linked visualizations. These tools are designed to help users ask deeper questions and get quick, visual answers from the data, whether or not if theyâ€™re marketing teams, analysts, or business leaders.

### What I did: 
- Turn raw data into clear, useful visuals

- Build interactive dashboards using web tools like D3.js

- Use data analysis techniques like clustering and trend exploration

- Make complex information easy to explore for any user

### ðŸš— **Lab 1 â€“ Exploratory Car Sales Dashboard: Basic Categorical & Numerical Analysis**

- Developed an interactive web dashboard using D3.js to explore relationships between car sales variables through scatterplots, bar charts, and histograms. Enabled users to compare categorical and numerical attributes (e.g., engine size, gender, color) to identify patterns in consumer behavior and vehicle characteristics. Designed dropdown filters and tooltips for enhanced data exploration.

### ðŸ“Š **Lab 2 â€“ Multivariate Analytics: PCA, MDS & Parallel Coordinates**

- Built a web-based analytical interface to uncover deeper multivariate relationships in the car sales dataset. Implemented correlation matrices, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with scree plots and biplots, and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) displays. Empowered users to visually analyze feature interdependencies and reduce dimensionality for better insights.

### ðŸ“Œ **Lab 3 â€“ K-Means Clustering Dashboard with Dynamic Filtering**
- Developed a coordinated dashboard where clicking on a specific category in a bar chart assigns a unique legend color and highlights matching data points across all other charts. This interactivity helps users quickly spot trends, compare clusters, and better understand how variables relate to one another in a connected view.

- Designed an interactive clustering tool using K-Means to segment car buyers and vehicle preferences. Integrated adjustable cluster counts and real-time filtering based on key variables (e.g., price, horsepower, MPG). Visualized cluster separation via scatterplots and centroids to support data-driven marketing strategies and customer segmentation.

### ðŸ“ˆ **Lab 4 â€“ Linked Car Sales Dashboard Suite: Coordinated Multiple Views**

-  Created an interconnected dashboard system with four synchronized visualizations (scatterplots, bar charts, pie charts, and histograms). Enabled dynamic linkingâ€”changing filters in one chart automatically updated all others. Focused on visual storytelling of car sales trends across variables like income, fuel type, transmission, and company to support executive-level data exploration.
