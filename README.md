# Car Sales Dataset Advanced Visualization Dashboard



### ðŸš— **Lab 1 â€“ Exploratory Car Sales Dashboard: Basic Categorical & Numerical Analysis**

- Developed an interactive web dashboard using D3.js to explore relationships between car sales variables through scatterplots, bar charts, and histograms. Enabled users to compare categorical and numerical attributes (e.g., engine size, gender, color) to identify patterns in consumer behavior and vehicle characteristics. Designed dropdown filters and tooltips for enhanced data exploration.

### ðŸ“Š **Lab 2 â€“ Multivariate Analytics: PCA, MDS & Parallel Coordinates**

- Built a web-based analytical interface to uncover deeper multivariate relationships in the car sales dataset. Implemented correlation matrices, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with scree plots and biplots, and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) displays. Empowered users to visually analyze feature interdependencies and reduce dimensionality for better insights.

### ðŸ“Œ **Lab 3 â€“ K-Means Clustering Dashboard with Dynamic Filtering**

- Designed an interactive clustering tool using K-Means to segment car buyers and vehicle preferences. Integrated adjustable cluster counts and real-time filtering based on key variables (e.g., price, horsepower, MPG). Visualized cluster separation via scatterplots and centroids to support data-driven marketing strategies and customer segmentation.

### ðŸ“ˆ **Lab 4 â€“ Linked Car Sales Dashboard Suite: Coordinated Multiple Views**

-  Created an interconnected dashboard system with four synchronized visualizations (scatterplots, bar charts, pie charts, and histograms). Enabled dynamic linkingâ€”changing filters in one chart automatically updated all others. Focused on visual storytelling of car sales trends across variables like income, fuel type, transmission, and company to support executive-level data exploration.
