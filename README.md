# üöñ  Car Sales Dataset Advanced Visualization Dashboard

This academic project is a multi-part interactive dashboard series that explores car sales trends and key product segmentation. Using real-world-style data, I built a set of web-based tools to help users better understand patterns in vehicle features, buyer preferences, and market trends.

Each lab builds on the previous one, starting with simple charts and growing into full dashboards with dynamic filters, clustering, and linked visualizations. These tools are designed to help users ask deeper questions and get quick, visual answers from the data, whether or not if they‚Äôre marketing teams, analysts, or business leaders.

## üîç Key Insights

* **Fuel efficiency drops as car weight increases**
  Curb weight shows a strong negative correlation with highway MPG across all models. Heavier cars are consistently less fuel-efficient.

* **Cylinder count strongly reflects car class**

  * 4-cylinder cars are lightweight, highly fuel-efficient, and tightly clustered.
  * 6-cylinder cars balance power and efficiency.
  * 8-cylinder cars are large, high-performance, but fuel-consuming.

* **Horsepower significantly impacts pricing**
  There's a clear upward trend in price as horsepower increases across all body types.

  * Sedans have the steepest slope which indicates higher price per horse power.
  * Hatchbacks have the shallowest slope which indicates practical and budget-friendly option.

* **Clustering reveals distinct vehicle segments**
  K-Means clustering identifies 4 main groups:

  * Compact, efficient cars
  * Balanced midsize models
  * High-performance, large vehicles (e.g., SUVs)
  * Variants in between
    Car height emerges as a key feature differentiating these groups.

* **High-priced cars prioritize efficiency-focused design**
  Vehicles in the top price tier tend to have taller builds, smaller dimensions, lower curb weight, and higher MPG.
  Lower-priced cars are longer, wider, and less fuel-efficient.

* **Drive type is specialized by body style**
  Sedans and wagons almost exclusively use front-wheel drive, indicating a strong design intent for urban/suburban use with better fuel control and handling.

## üíº Business Actions

* **Target 4-cylinder models** to fuel-conscious, urban buyers.
* **Price sedans at a premium** for higher horsepower value.
* **Market hatchbacks** as cost-effective, practical options.
* **Segment inventory** using cluster insights to match buyer personas.
* **Highlight FWD sedans and wagons** for city-focused marketing.
* **Use weight and height patterns** to guide pricing and design decisions.
